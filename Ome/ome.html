                    <p2>Most the time I do play games. It is not so suitable for parents. On one side they were
                        right. I lost half my life by playing games. But if I will not play games. I would not force
                        myself to learn English. New game and it forced me to translate the important words.
                        Actually you want know the story of game. So it is one pint good. Then I get better
                        reactions. Map orientations, orientatiton outside etc. </p2>

                            all day. That is bad...For you, your friends and mainly for your parents. Your body gets
                            hurt (muscless and brain are not fit), because you do not drink sometimes. Be honest to
                            yourself. Then you can not move
                            properly. Also your mood goes odd way. Your parents says (I dont saw you all day. Come and
                            sit.) Some friends would spent more time with you, but they cant because you still plays.
                            With this attitude soon you sent your body to scrap. </p2>

                        <h2>1.Sandbox</h1>
                            <p2>The term “sandbox” may be more recognizable from its usage in tech or even as an
                                open-ended
                                mode available within certain games. It’s often associated with player choice, open
                                environments, and non-linear gameplay. The sandbox genre has grown from a small niche to
                                encompass a huge variety of titles.
                                In these games, players often have less concrete goals and narrative pathways to pursue.
                                Instead of beating the boss and saving the princess, you may face a variety of tasks you
                                can
                                accomplish in a number of different ways. This draws players into more immersive
                                experiences, encouraging experimentation with what may be unfamiliar mechanics.
                                Sandbox titles can sometimes be highly conceptual and even lack some of the most
                                recognizable gameplay elements. The 1984 game Elite is a key example, with a simple
                                design
                                and play focused on combat, exploration, and trading. It also showcased an early
                                instance of
                                procedural generation.
                                Simulation games like The Sims are also increasingly touted as sandbox titles, as are
                                many
                                popular franchises, including both Minecraft and Grand Theft Auto. As game worlds expand
                                and
                                narratives diversify, expect more of an overlap with other gaming genres.

                        <p2>Originally coined as a marketing term for Westwood Studios’ Dune II, real-time strategy
                            games
                            were around for years before most players knew what the genre was. Thanks to their enduring
                            popularity and the growth of new sub-genres, RTS games remain a conspicuous part of the
                            video
                            game landscape. In the archetypal RTS title, Dune II human and AI players control different
                            factions and compete against each other simultaneously in “real time” hence the term
                            “real-time
                            strategy,” as opposed to turn-based strategy. These games typically include resource and map
                            management, and they often feature a top-down view.
                            Warcraft, Age of Empires, and Command & Conquer are among the most popular RTS titles, but
                            the
                            list doesn’t stop there. And when it comes to turn-based strategy games, enthusiasts tout
                            the
                            Civilization series and other notable franchises. There are also titles that deliberately
                            blend
                            elements of both styles for mixed gameplay, like the Total War franchise. To find out about

                        <h2>3.Shooter (FPS and TPS)</h2>
                        <p2>The shooter is another long-standing genre that developed several early offshoots and
                            branched
                            out into two primary sub-genres: the first-person shooter (FPS) and third-person shooter
                            (TPS).
                            There’s plenty of potential for overlap here, too, since many contemporary titles allow you
                            to
                            toggle between first and third-person viewpoints. Not only that, but most battle royale
                            games –
                            a sub-genre unto itself – operate as either first or third-person shooters, including
                            Fortnite
                            and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds.
                            The key difference is perspective. An FPS simulates a typical human viewpoint, showing
                            essentially what your in-game character sees in franchises like Half-Life, Call of Duty, and
                            DOOM. A TPS pulls the perspective back and showcases your entire character and surrounding
                            environment, such as in the Gears of War and Tom Clancy’s The Division series.
                            The premise for these games is simple, but it’s been repackaged in many ways over the years.
                            Older players probably remember the earliest arcade and gallery-style shooters with
                            on-the-rails
                            gameplay and relatively simple environments. Then there are shoot-em-ups (or shmups) and
                            bullet-hell games, both of which rely heavily on twitchy gameplay involving plenty of
                            shooting.
                            While most shooter games split into FPS and TPS gameplay, they’re frequently talked about as
                            elements in other games. Grand Theft Auto V is an example of overlap. It rides the new wave
                            of modern sandbox games, but it also has substantial TPS elements (and you can play it in
                            first-person if you want). By contrast, the Halo series is primarily known for its
                            groundbreaking FPS gameplay.

                        <h2>4. Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA)</h2>
                        <p2>An increasingly popular subgenre with connections to a variety of other styles, multiplayer
                            online battle arena games share many features with real-time strategy games. There’s a
                            top-down perspective that emphasizes map and resource management, plus real-time competition
                            between players.
                            The major difference between MOBAs and RTS games is the player’s character and role. In a
                            MOBA, you may have a faction alignment and many of the RTS basics in play, but you typically
                            only control a single character. That’s a significant contrast with most RTS games, where
                            you build communities and command multiple units.
                            MOBA games also prioritize multiplayer and team play. While some well-known titles feature
                            AI-controlled elements, you usually play with and compete against other human players to
                            meet a set of victory conditions.
                            The niche is dominated by Dota 2 and League of Legends, both of which have developed
                            substantial audiences in eSports. Want to know more about this growing genre? Check out our

                        <h2>5. Role-playing games (RPG, ARPG, and more)</h2>
                        <p2>The basic premise of the role-playing game is simple and ubiquitous in numerous games: you
                            create or take control of a character that you can then level up through experience points.
                            RPGs are a cornerstone of gaming, but no single game can represent the genre because it’s
                            grown and blossomed into numerous sub-genres. With that in mind, here are the most popular
                            sub-genres with a short explanation for each.</p2>

                                    gaming with cards and dice (Dungeons & Dragons) to video game RPGs (Fallout).</li>
                                <li>ARPG: Action RPGs have a strong emphasis on combat but include many of the
                                    characteristics of a standard RPG, like The Witcher 3.</li>
                                <li>CRPG: “Computer RPG” is typically used to describe Western-developed RPGs created
                                    for PC gamers, like the first two Fallout games.</li>
                                <li>MMORPG: Combines the massively multiplayer online genre format with RPG gameplay,
                                    with notable titles like World of Warcraft, EVE Online, and Elder Scrolls Online.
                                </li>
                                <li>TRPG: Short for tactical role-playing game, TRPGs resemble strategy games but place
                                    a deeper emphasis on creative thinking and short-term decision making, like the XCOM
                                    series.</li>
                                <li>Roguelike: Strict definitions feature turn-based gameplay, some form of permadeath,
                                    tile graphics, and procedural generation. However, many newer and popular examples,
                                    like The Binding of Isaac and Spelunky, focus more on action and platforming,
                                    respectively.</li>
                                <li>Roguelite: Does not include one or more key elements of a typical roguelike.
                                    Definitions for this sub-genre will vary, but Rogue Legacy is a widely accepted
                                    example.</li>

                        <h2>6. Simulation and sports</h2>
                        <p2>These genres have evolved a lot over the years and you may actually see them in the same
                            light. But it’s only with advances in graphics technology that they’ve begun to offer unique
                            immersive experiences. The latest iterations provide impressive levels of detail and
                            showcase just how much is possible with games.
                            Sports games have expanded in variety, offering full-fledged partnerships with major
                            sporting organizations, from race tracks to the field or court. NBA 2K and Madden NFL are
                            two well-known examples that feature detailed recreations of professional basketball and
                            football, while Forza is a simulation-style car racing game.
                            The simulation genre encompasses many sandbox titles, world-building games, and virtual
                            reality games. The typical focus is on creating an immersive and realistic game world with
                            epic scenarios, while smaller experiences may center on a particular area or experience.
                            Minecraft and The Sims are good examples of simulation games that also fit into the sandbox
                            niche. For more reading on the sim genre, check out our article on the 6 Best Simulation

                        <h2>7. Puzzlers and party games</h2>
                        <p2>Puzzlers and party games also have a significant overlap, with both emphasizing game
                            mechanics. You can expect to play a game based on a theme or a traditional tabletop game
                            with particular rule sets.
                            Party games take that premise a little further and often include multiplayer elements. They
                            also double-down on gameplay. The Mario Party series is particularly popular, and it spawned
                            more than 10 installments and spin-offs.
                            Puzzlers, also known as puzzle games, can be as simple as Minesweeper or more deeply
                            immersive, with fully developed environments and hybrid gameplay. The Tomb Raider series is
                            a good example, where puzzles are built into a conventional adventure narrative and setting,
                            making them a key game mechanic. Also, mini-maps are often presented as puzzles you solve
                            (or uncover) throughout the course of the game.</p2>

                        <h2>8. Action-adventure</h2>
                        <p2>Among the earliest recognizable hybrid genres, action-adventure games have a deep focus on
                            plot and combat through story involvement and tight gameplay mechanics. As a result, many
                            games can fit into this category, including the classic Legend of Zelda franchise that paved
                            the way for numerous franchises.
                            Most users draw the line between action and adventure in how a game balances story and
                            features like simulated combat. Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed series has been a mainstay since
                            2007 thanks to near-annual new releases featuring a high degree of immersion. They have also
                            taken gamers to myriad locales and historical landscapes ranging from London during the
                            Industrial Revolution (Syndicate) to ancient Greece (Odyssey).
                            Released in late 2019, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is another well-received
                            action-adventure title from the folks at Respawn, who previously worked on the Titanfall
                            series. Other more modern examples include the Watch Dogs series, Sekiro, and the Arkham
                            games.
                            It’s worth noting that adventure games encompass their own genre as well. Many of them fall
                            into the point-and-click sub-genre, which typically involves players solving mysteries or
                            puzzles in a first-person perspective. Think of classic titles like Escape From Monkey
                            Island, King’s Quest, and Day Of The Tentacle as mainstays of this sub-genre.</p2>

                        <h2>9. Survival and horror</h2>
                        <p2>Survival and horror games have a lot of overlap, to the point that they even created their
                            own sub-genre (survival horror). In particular, horror games often share some basic features
                            with their survival counterparts, though the reverse is less often true. As developers add
                            more FPS and conventional shooter features to certain horror and survival titles, there’s
                            even ongoing debate about how to define these games.
                            The core mechanics of a survival game centers on resource management, often incorporating
                            crafting or salvage systems that you can use to help keep your character alive. Minecraft is
                            a popular standout, as is Don’t Starve. And then there are games like The Long Dark, which
                            focuses entirely on survival elements with a dedicated mode that increases difficulty.
                            Horror is an even broader category, arguably encompassing dozens of survival titles. Almost
                            anything with zombies, a post-apocalyptic storyline, or loads of jump scares is considered
                            horror. These titles are often psychological, too, and use tension to immerse the player in
                            the game. On the pure horror side, you have games like Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Alien:
                            Isolation, and Blair Witch. However, the most popular horror titles tend to fall into the
                            survival-horror side of things, such as the Resident Evil and Evil Within franchises.</p2>

                        <h2>10. Platformer</h2>
                        <p2>Looking for a genre that hasn’t changed much in concept over the years? When it comes to
                            nostalgia and devotion to craft, the platformer genre covers a huge variety of games that
                            still proudly showcase their roots in the earliest 2D side-scrollers. Platformers involve
                            running, climbing, and jumping as the player explores and works their way through
                            challenging levels.
                            Platform games feature a side view and simple controls, with Donkey Kong often considered
                            the first true example. That game passed the torch to Super Mario Bros. and later Sonic the
                            Hedgehog. Moving another several years forward, Naughty Dog’s first Crash Bandicoot title
                            found its audience with a different camera angle (head-on) and loads of charm.
                            Platformers are extremely popular with indie studios and gamers, as well as legacy releases.
                            There are also plenty of RPG crossovers and excursions into even more obscure niches as
                            well. Ori and the Blind Forest is a popular example that incorporates puzzles and adventure
                            elements, as is Cuphead, which is both beautifully animated and deeply challenging.</p2>
