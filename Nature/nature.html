                It is right. We can not lives with out nature. The world is one big organism. Connected together.
                When
                one part is missing it does not works properly. It is as when you have not oil in your car.

            <p2>Nothing compares if you go to the woods for a walk or camp. Some people prefer travel have a
                holiday in hotel. Nonsence. All year we are closed in buildings and hardly moving. For example if
                you
                lives in the city. Your needs are money to go out. So if you travel into woods you need only an good
                equipment for that and good. Then you can enjoy the nature. Sometimes you can takes something with
                you
                back. What have you saw. Mainly your health. Mental health, physical health (tired from walking,
                rested
                from city noice).

            <p2>When you go out you can always find something interesting. Actually something what can heals you.
                First
                check the herb vocabluary. Remember very well the picture of plant what do you want to find. Some
                flovers are too similar. Also some are bad and not good for touch. Just a touch can makes you dizzy.

                <h3>Forest</h3>
                <p3>In the forest it is very simple. Youcan go where do you want. Keep you eeyes open wide. Then
                    you can
                    be creative. Enjoy the nature and do not make so much noice. Then all animals run away and
                    you just
                    was on a walk. Even walk can help.</p3>

                    <h3>Mountain</h3>
                    <p3>For mountain walk be always well prepared. The weather can change every hour. Do not get
                        lost
                        therefore rather take a map. Even you got a phone. Your battery run out or you accidentaly
                        breake
                        the phone. Then its hard get back.</p3>

                <h3>Beach</h3>
                <p3>Before you leave house count with the tide. Rather check the tide times on net. Then count

                    <h3>Desert</h3>
                    <p3>The desert is not very well place to stay. Therefore drink a water. Consider how much water
                    left for
                    you and how long it takes you out off the deset where is naother water. Use also a head
                    cover (hat).
                    It keeps you cover before the sun. Better have some cover on body even is too hot. Direct
                    sun shine
                    can be automatically end of you journey.</p3>
